The canvas' infomation include id,sharedata
+ **Current**
The active node infomation include id,type,describe

The sub canvas array of the main canvas

### Share Data
ShareData will cross throught the wholly period. You have to binding a specific script if you need,or else just do nothing.

***How to binding a script***
+ step1

[ShareDataBinding("19041921060585")]// you copy the canvas information
public class ShareDataTest : SharedData
{
    /*
     * your share data structure
    */
}
```

**Note:** the node script must derived from the class named 'SharedData'.

<br/>

### Start
It's the start point of current canvas. You do not anything for this ,cause auto create the one when generate a canvas.

[NodeBinding("19041921060585", "19041923144744")]//you copy the node infomation
public class NodeTest : Node
{
    public NodeTest(SharedData data) : base(data) { }

    public override void execute()
    {
        /*
         * your code
         */

        //call finish method when current node finish you're sure
        finish(true);
    }
}
```

**Note:** the node script must derived from the class named 'Node'.

<br/>

### Router

It's very important, it will decide which one is the next one. You can add a condition item by '+' button, and you must binding a specific script for every condition item.

***How to binding a condition script***
+ step1
Expand the condition item, copy the condition infomation by copy button.
![avator](pic/routerCopy.png)
+ step2
Paste the node information in your condition script's header space.
```
[RouterBinding("19041921060585", "19042021275763", "19042021275926")]// you copy the condition infomation
public class ConditionTest : RouterCondition
{
    public ConditionTest(SharedData data) : base(data) { }

    public override bool justify()
    {
        //get shared data
        testShareData data = shareData as testShareData;

        //return your result. True:passed False:refuse
        return data.state == 1;
    }
}
```

**Note:** the condition script must derived from the class named 'RouterCondition'.

<br/>

### Use it

API: $Instantiate$

```
public class test:MonoBehaviour
{
    public CodeMindData mindData;

    CodeMindController controller;
    private void Awake()
    {
        controller = mindData.Instantiate();
        controller.onFinish += Test_onFinish;
    }

    private void Test_onFinish(bool obj)
    {
        Debug.Log("State=>" + obj);
        //Destroy(controller.gameObject);
    }
}
```
<br/>

### Runntime state

After you instantiate a CodeMind item, you can click a 'Graph' button in Inspector.

### Work Flow

+ step1
Designer finish the canvas by productâ€™s logic mind
+ step2
Developer binding every node's script
+ step3
Run and check

**Note:** You can creat a circle flow, but I don't advocate that, cause it never stop.
