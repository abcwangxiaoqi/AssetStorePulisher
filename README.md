    so that we must definate so many interfaces,that will make thing complex.</p>

<strong>The tool will make things simple,you just take attention into the module logical functions,and it will link every module according your design.</strong>


<p>There is a document that help you a lot, that contain many detail about per step about how to build first your flow.</p>


<strong>PS: If you were a developer, will take it soon :-)</strong>
