## Code Mind

<strong>A simple logical flow design tool</strong>

<p>Normally it's diffcult to link every logic module in the game devlopement prograss,cause every single developer has different code style,
    so that we must definate so many interfaces,that will make thing complex.</p>

<strong>The tool will make things simple,you just take attention into the module logical functions,and it will link every module according your design.</strong>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/abcwangxiaoqi/AssetStorePulisher/blob/master/ScriptNodeFlow/README.md">Document</a> that help you a lot, that contain many detail about per step about how to build first your canvas.</p>
